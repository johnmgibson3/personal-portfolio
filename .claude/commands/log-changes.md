description: Update documentation with recent development work
---

You have just completed development work. Update the project documentation to reflect the changes.

## Your Task:

1. **Read Current Documentation**
   - Read `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
   - Read `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`

2. **Analyze Recent Changes**
   - Review the conversation history to understand what was just built/modified
   - Identify which files were created, modified, or deleted
   - Determine if architectural changes were made

3. **Update DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md**
   - Add a new entry under today's date
   - If an entry for today already exists, append to it (don't create duplicate date headers)
   - Write a concise summary including:
     - Brief overview of what was built
     - Files created/modified
     - Key features implemented
     - Technical details worth noting
   - Keep it professional but concise

4. **Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md (ONLY IF NEEDED)**
   - Determine if architectural changes were made:
     - New directories added
     - New major dependencies
     - Changes to how to run/build the app
     - New API endpoints or routes
     - Changes to project structure
   - If YES: Update the relevant sections in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
   - If NO: Skip this file (don't update it unnecessarily)

5. **Report Back**
   - Confirm which files you updated
   - Provide a brief summary of what was documented

## Important Notes:
- Be intelligent about what constitutes an "architectural change" - component additions are not architectural
- Keep documentation concise and scannable
- If multiple features were added today, keep them under a single date header
- Only update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md if there are genuine structural/setup changes
