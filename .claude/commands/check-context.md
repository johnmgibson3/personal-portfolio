description: Read project documentation to understand current state
---

Read and summarize the following files to understand the project context:

1. PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md - Project architecture, structure, and setup
2. DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md - Recent changes and development history

After reading both files, provide a brief summary highlighting:
- Key project technologies and structure
- Most recent changes/features added
- Any important notes or gotchas from recent work

This helps get up to speed quickly at the start of a session.
